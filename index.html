        <h2>Welcome to Shopify App Development</h2>
        <p>Shopify embedded apps are a wonderful way to extend the functionality of your store and provide a seamless experience for the vendor. Today we will go through setting up a custom embeded application. We will be leveraging tools provided by Shopify to help us get our app authenticated and up and running. One of the major benefits of creating an app in this way is that we will be able to embed the app directly in our merchants Shopify admin.</p>

        <h2>Getting Started on Shopify</h2>
        <p>Shopify offers a multitude of resources to help with development. One of these tools is the Shopify partner account. With a partner account you can create development stores to test out your themes and applicaitons.</p>
        <p>To get started today make sure you have a partner account. You can <a href="https://www.shopify.ca/partners" target="_blank">sign up for a partner account</a></p>
        <p>Now create a development store. This will act as a sandbox where we can use our app. Once you have created your development store log in to the store admin and take a look around.</p>
        <p>In the app we create today we are going to work with product information from the Shopify store. Let's set up our store with some products so that we have something to look at in our app later. Download <a href="bicycles.csv" download>this product csv</a> and upload it to the products section in your store.</p>

        <h2>Create a new rails application</h2>
        <p>Now that we have our store set up we are going to create our application. We'll start by creating a new Rails application and then we'll set it up to authenticate with our Shopify store.</p>
        <p>If you're not familiar with Ruby on Rails, no problem. We are going to use a few terminal commands to create a new Ruby on Rails application and set it up with the <a href="https://github.com/Shopify/shopify_app" target="_blank">Shopify App Gem</a> to fecilitate authenticaiton.</p>
        <p>To start open your terminal and navigate to wherever on your computer you would like to keep your application. Once in the correct directory, create a new Ruby on Rails application by running:</p>
        <pre><code>
            rails new [appname]
        </code></pre>
        <p>Then go into the root directory of your app</p>
        <pre><code>
            $ cd [appname]
        </code></pre>
        <p>Once in the root directory of your app run</p>
        <pre><code>
            echo "gem 'shopify_app'" >> Gemfile
        </code></pre>
        <p>This will add the shopify_app gem to your gemfile. You can open up your Gemfile and see wherer the gem was added</p>
        <p>Finally, still in the root directory, run</p>
        <pre><code>
            $ bundle install
        </code></pre>
        <p>That gives us the base set up for our applicaiton. Let's start up the rails server and check out our app locally. Running the following command in the root directory of your app will start up the server.</p>
        <pre><code>
            rails s
        </code></pre>

       <h2>Create Your App Token and Secret</h2>
       <p>Now that we have created our Rails application we are going to generate an app token and secret on the Shopify end.</p>
       <p>Back in your partner dashboard navigate to the apps tab and create a new app.</p>
       <img src="images/create-new-app.png" alt="">
       <p>You can call your app whatever you like. Where it says <strong>app url</strong> for now we are going to put in the localhost address where our rails application is being served. This is likely <strong>http://localhost:3000/</strong>. Make sure you include the url protocol.</p>
       <p>Now that you have created the app, we are going to grab the credentials we need to authenticate. At the top you'll see a green box with a button to <strong>Get API credentials</strong>.</p>
       <img src="images/get-api-credentials.png" alt="">
       <p>Down at the bottom of the screen in the <strong>App credentials</strong> section you'll see you have your <strong>API key</strong> and <strong>API secret key</strong>. Keep this page open as we will be using these in a second.</p>
